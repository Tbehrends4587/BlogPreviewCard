## My process

I like to start with writing HTML first, then add CSS. Then possibly go back and see if I need to tweak the HTML. But always try to vision the layout in HTML first while thinking in the box method. When writing in CSS I like to start with a mobile view first because it is easier to be more respoonsive to the screen size and then work my way up to a desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (I like to think so)
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox (mainly because its better for this project)
- Mobile-first workflow (always best)

### What I learned

I learned how to use box-sizing: border-box. This is something I did not know before and it is a very useful property. I did not know that messing with padding does not count towards the overall width of the box so it is useful to get actual sizes for stuff. 


### Continued development

I thought I did good with html and css classes but I found myself going back and messing with the names. I think more practice is needed in that regard but I am sure it comes with time. I also thing being able to use less css is a good thing to work on. I do not want to keep repeating myself and adding unnecessary code.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) - A cheat sheet for CSS, always helpful
