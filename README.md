## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page (This is interesting)

### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

I like to start with writing HTML first, then add CSS. Then possibly go back and see if I need to tweak the HTML. But always try to vision the layout in HTML first while thinking in the box method. When writing in CSS I like to start with a mobile view first because it is easier to be more respoonsive to the screen size and then work my way up to a desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (I like to think so)
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox (mainly because its better for this project)
- Mobile-first workflow (always best)

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
